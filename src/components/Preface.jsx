            Hello! I'm Jay, a software engineer and financial engineer based in the NYC Metro area. 
            With nearly a decade of experience in tech, four years professionally and countless hours on personal projects, 
            I thrive on automating the mundane and crafting custom, minimalistic experiences that make life simpler.

            , I've migrated outdated UIs into React applications and enhanced our CI/CD pipelines with additional tests, 
            significantly improving deployment efficiency and reducing defects. Driven by perfectionism, simplicity, 
            and a passion for continuous learning, I'm always ready for the next big challenge.

            Outside of work, I spend time on side projects like creating a

            . I also extend my master's research in financial engineering to 
            analyze trade data and identify informed trades. But life isn't <Text fw={700} span>all</Text> about tech and finance; 
            I also love learning about topics ranging from
